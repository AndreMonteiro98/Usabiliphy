 The techniques used to assess usability, user experience, emotions, etc., perceived by users
 when using applications are predominantly based on questionnaires. Although these question
naires yield solid results, they can become monotonous, tiresome, and even demanding, poten
tially triggering negative feelings in users and consequently affecting the reliability of the ques
tionnaires.
 One way to overcome these issues would be to infer usability, user experience, and perceived
 emotions from users’ physiological signals while they use the applications. To achieve this in
ference, it is necessary to have reliable information that allows for a correlation between physi
ological signals and usability and user experience measures. This work represents a first step in
 this direction, and our goal is to create a dataset composed of users’ physiological signals and the
 results of standard questionnaires while they interact with interactive applications. To accomplish
 this, we conducted two user experiments in which participants performed a set of tasks in inter
active applications while we collected their physiological signals and their responses to standard
 questionnaires.
 At the end of the study, we validated the data through statistical analysis, which revealed that
 there was no statistical differences between the two experiments. Based on this validation, we
 constructed a dataset that includes physiological signals (electroencephalography, photoplethys
mography, accelerometer, gyroscope) and scores from standard questionnaires (System Usability
 Scale, User Experience Questionnaire Short, Single Ease Question, NASA Task Load Index, Us
ability Metric for User Experience Lite, Self-Assessment Manikin).
 This dataset will enable future research to investigate the relationship between these two types
 of data and subsequently create models to infer perceived usability from physiological signals,
 eliminating the need for questionnaire completion, improving user testing sessions, and reducing
 their duration.
