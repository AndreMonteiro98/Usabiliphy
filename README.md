 The techniques used to assess usability, user experience, emotions, etc., perceived by users
when using applications are predominantly based on questionnaires. Although these questionnaires 
yield solid results, they can become monotonous, tiresome, and even demanding, potentially 
triggering negative feelings in users and consequently affecting the reliability of the questionnaires.
 One way to overcome these issues would be to infer usability, user experience, and perceived
emotions from users’ physiological signals while they use the applications. To achieve this inference, 
it is necessary to have reliable information that allows for a correlation between physiological 
signals and usability and user experience measures. This work represents a first step in this 
direction, and our goal is to create a dataset composed of users’ physiological signals and the
results of standard questionnaires while they interact with interactive applications. To accomplish
this, we conducted two user experiments in which participants performed a set of tasks in interactive 
applications while we collected their physiological signals and their responses to standard
questionnaires.
 At the end of the study, we validated the data through statistical analysis, which revealed that
there was no statistical differences between the two experiments. Based on this validation, we
constructed a dataset that includes physiological signals (electroencephalography, photoplethys-
mography, accelerometer, gyroscope) and scores from standard questionnaires (System Usability
Scale, User Experience Questionnaire Short, Single Ease Question, NASA Task Load Index, Usability 
Metric for User Experience Lite, Self-Assessment Manikin).
 This dataset will enable future research to investigate the relationship between these two types
of data and subsequently create models to infer perceived usability from physiological signals,
eliminating the need for questionnaire completion, improving user testing sessions, and reducing
their duration.
